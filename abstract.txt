This basic/intermediate R workshop will introduce participants to exploratory data analysis [EDA] and the `ggplot2` package.  Theoretical topics include the goals of EDA; the role of visualization in EDA; and the "Grammar of Graphics," the graphics paradigm behind `ggplot2`.  Most of the workshop will be spent learning how to use `ggplot2` to create a variety of graphs.  Participants should bring a laptop with a working R installation.
